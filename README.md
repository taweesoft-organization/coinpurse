## Coin Purse Tests

This project has JUnit tests for the Coin Purse.
Test classes are in the `test` source directory.
To create an IDE project from this code, include both
the `src` and `test` directories as "Source" directories.

I create a JAR file containing only the test code
and a runnable class named `TestRunner` to run tests
on the console.  TestRunner prints results that are
easier for me to read than JUnit's output.

The JAR file(s) are in the top directory.

`CoinpurseTest1.jar` - tests for Lab 2 (version 1 of Coin Purse)
